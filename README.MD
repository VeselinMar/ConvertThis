# ConvertThis

Got tired of sharing my files with dubious online pdf-convert-pages therefore I decided to do it locally with python scripts

Script searches for files of specific type in specific directories and converts them to another type.

Just change the input_path and output_path and convert as you wish.

Available functionalities:
1. pdf-word
2. word-pdf
